Keyboard Smashing or Gibberish\n   - If the response contains unrecognizable, random text (e.g., \"asdfgh\", \"qwerty\", \"jnrbcfbcj\", \"@#$$%\") with no valid words or known entities, return `None`.\n   - Use heuristics such as: non-dictionary words, lack of vowels, too many repeated letters/symbols, or absence of contextually valid content.\n\n3. Context Validation\n   - Ensure the response refers to a real, recognized sports team. If it doesn't, return `[REVIEW]`.\n\n4. Normalization and Standardization\n   - Correct misspellings, abbreviations, or informal names.\n   - Expand common shorthand (e.g., \"Man U\" \u2192 \"Manchester United\", \"Barca\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Use the official full name of the team where possible (e.g., \"Barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Apply consistent formatting in Title Case (e.g., \"fc barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n\n5.

Keyboard Smashing or Gibberish\n   - If the response contains unrecognizable, random text (e.g., \"asdfgh\", \"qwerty\", \"jnrbcfbcj\", \"@#$$%\") with no valid words or known entities, return `None`.\n   - Use heuristics such as: non-dictionary words, lack of vowels, too many repeated letters/symbols, or absence of contextually valid content.\n\n3. Context Validation\n   - Ensure the response refers to a real, recognized sports team. If it doesn't, return `[REVIEW]`.\n\n4. Normalization and Standardization\n   - Correct misspellings, abbreviations, or informal names.\n   - Expand common shorthand (e.g., \"Man U\" \u2192 \"Manchester United\", \"Barca\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Use the official full name of the team where possible (e.g., \"Barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Apply consistent formatting in Title Case (e.g., \"fc barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n\n5.

Keyboard Smashing or Gibberish\n   - If the response contains unrecognizable, random text (e.g., \"asdfgh\", \"qwerty\", \"jnrbcfbcj\", \"@#$$%\") with no valid words or known entities, return `None`.\n   - Use heuristics such as: non-dictionary words, lack of vowels, too many repeated letters/symbols, or absence of contextually valid content.\n\n3. Context Validation\n   - Ensure the response refers to a real, recognized sports team. If it doesn't, return `[REVIEW]`.\n\n4. Normalization and Standardization\n   - Correct misspellings, abbreviations, or informal names.\n   - Expand common shorthand (e.g., \"Man U\" \u2192 \"Manchester United\", \"Barca\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Use the official full name of the team where possible (e.g., \"Barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n   - Apply consistent formatting in Title Case (e.g., \"fc barcelona\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\").\n\n5. Remove Qualifiers\n   - Eliminate introductory phrases like \"I like\", \"My favorite is\", etc. Return only the cleaned team name.\n\n6.
