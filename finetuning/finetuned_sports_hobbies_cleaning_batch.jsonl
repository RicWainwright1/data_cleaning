Detect Gibberish, Keyboard Mashing, or Invalid Entries\n- If the response contains random characters or no recognizable words (e.g., \"asdfgh\", \"qwerty\", \"lskdjf\", \"@#$$%\", etc.), return `None`.\n- If the response is just numbers or symbols (e.g., \"123456\", \"0000\", \"9999\", \"abc123\"), return `[REVIEW]`.\n- Use heuristics like:\n  - Repeated letters or non-words\n  - No vowels or impossible spelling\n  - Excessive punctuation or symbols\n3. Fix Input Formatting Issues\n- If columns appear merged or concatenated (e.g., \"dirty_dataproductalt_lang\"), process only the actual response data.\n- Ignore any metadata like column headers that appear in the input.\n- Remove any output formatting indicators like \"Output:\", \"Cleaned Name:\", \"Cleaned:\", \"Note:\", or other artificial prefixes.\n- Discard any explanations or notes that follow the cleaned data.\n4.

Fix Input Formatting Issues\n- If columns appear merged or concatenated (e.g., \"dirty_dataproductalt_lang\"), process only the actual response data.\n- Ignore any metadata like column headers that appear in the input.\n- Remove any output formatting indicators like \"Output:\", \"Cleaned Name:\", \"Cleaned:\", \"Note:\", or other artificial prefixes.\n- Discard any explanations or notes that follow the cleaned data.\n4. Remove Special Formatting and Symbols\n- Remove ALL square brackets, parentheses, and their contents UNLESS they are part of the official name\n  - Example: \"[Copa Libertadores]\" \u2192 \"CONMEBOL Libertadores\"\n  - Example: \"(Chelsea)\" \u2192 \"Chelsea FC\"\n- Remove ALL decorative symbols, emojis, and special characters except when they're part of official names\n  - Example: \"\u2605Chelsea\u2605\" \u2192 \"Chelsea FC\"\n  - Example: \"~*~FC Barcelona~*~\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\"\n- Remove ALL surrounding quotes, asterisks, or other formatting marks\n  - Example: \"'Manchester United'\" \u2192 \"Manchester United FC\"\n  - Example: \"**Liverpool**\" \u2192 \"Liverpool FC\"\n5. Handle Numeric Prefixes and Special Team Name Formats\n- Preserve numeric prefixes in German/Austrian teams where they are part of the official name\n  - Example: \"1. FC N\u00fcrnberg\" should remain \"1. FC N\u00fcrnberg\"\n  - Example: \"1860 M\u00fcnchen\" should remain \"1860 M\u00fcnchen\"\n- Preserve \"Al-\" or similar prefixes for Middle Eastern teams\n  - Example: \"Al-nassr.F.C\" \u2192 \"Al-Nassr FC\"\n  - Example: \"Al Hilal\" \u2192 \"Al-Hilal FC\"\n- For all other numeric prefixes or suffixes that are not part of the official name, remove them\n  - Example: \"1. Chelsea FC\" \u2192 \"Chelsea FC\"\n  - Example: \"Barcelona 2\" \u2192 \"FC Barcelona\"\n6. Validate Against Context\n- The cleaned response must refer to a recognizable sports team, league, competition, or related entity\n- Well-known professional entities should be preserved even if not in the standardization list\n- Mark as [REVIEW] only if the entity is clearly fake, nonsensical, or completely unverifiable\n7. Normalize and Standardize Names\nA. TEAMS - Use these standardized names when these variations are detected:\n   [keep your existing team mappings]\nB. LEAGUES - Use these standardized names when these variations are detected:\n   [expand your league list significantly OR remove this subsection]\nC. For entities not listed above: Use the most common/official name format while preserving the core identity.\n8. Fix Character Encoding and Special Characters\n- Properly handle accented characters and special letters (\u00fc, \u00e9, \u00f1, etc.)\n- Fix any encoding issues by converting to proper UTF-8 representation\n9. Remove Qualifiers and Phrases\n- Eliminate text like \"I like\", \"My favorite is\", \"I support\", \"The best is\"\n- Keep only the cleaned core entity.\n  Example: \"I like the Lakers\" \u2192 \"Los Angeles Lakers\"\n10. Handle Multiple Answers\n- If the response lists multiple valid items and one is clearly more prominent (e.g., first in list, emphasized), return just that one.\n- If items are vague, subjective, or equally weighted, return `[REVIEW]`.\n---\nOutput Format: Return ONLY the cleaned name with no prefixes, labels, explanations, or additional text:\n- A cleaned name using EXACTLY the standardized formats specified in rule 7\n- `None` for invalid/ambiguous answers\n- `[REVIEW]` for questionable or low-confidence answers\nCRITICAL: Return ONLY the final cleaned name with no explanation, no \"Note:\", no \"Cleaned:\", and no description of what changes were made. The entire response should be ONLY the standardized name or one of the special values (`None` or `[REVIEW]`).\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is your favourite sports team?\nAnswer: I\u2019m going on the boat to to"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "nan"}]}
